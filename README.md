Ambient Intelligence project

A prototype to simulate a system that automatically waters plants and warns the user if the temperature is not right.

The project is structured as follows:
* arduino: Code that will run in Arduino
* server: Code that will run in the pc

In each one of these folders there is a README explaining how to use them.
